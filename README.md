# AEV-Simulator
This Alternative Energy Vehicle simulator was created in the spring of 2016. The objective was to simulate designs for a vehicle our team had to create in an engineering class at OSU. After our team was nominated to go to a showcase for our creation, this was also used as a presentation tool, which helped us wih 2nd best presentation out of the 20+ teams.
